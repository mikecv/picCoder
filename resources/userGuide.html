<h1>picCode User Guide</h1>

<p><i><b>picCoder</b></i> enables data to be embedded inside
  particular image files using a technique called <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Steganography</span></i><span style="font-style: normal">,
  which comes from Greek steganographia, which combines the words
  stegan√≥s meaning &quot;covered or concealed&quot;, and -graphia
  meaning &quot;writing&quot;. In the case of </span><i><b>picCoder</b></i><span style="font-style: normal">,
  data is concealed in variations of the colour of image pixels.</span></p>
  <br>
  
<a id="ImageTypes"></a>
><h2>Image Types Supported</h2>
  
<p>The nature of the data embedding employed means that if images are graphically manipulated after they have been encoded picCoder encoding may be corrupted.
  For this reason presently only .png images are supported as they support lossless compression.</p>

<h2>Opening an Image</h2>

<p>To open an image use the <font color="#2a6099"><i>Open Image</i></font> option from the <font color="#2a6099"><i>File</i></font> menu as
  illustrated below. Alternatively, drag and drop an accepted image file (.png) onto the application window.</p>
  <br>
  <br>  
  <img src="./resources/openFileMenu.png" alt="Open file menu">
  <br>  

<p>If an accepted image file type was selected the image will be displayed in the application window as illustrated below.</p>
  <br>
  <br>  
  <img src="./resources/openedImage.png" alt="Opened image">
  <br>

<p>In the previous illustration the image file opened has not been <i><b>picCoder</b></i>
  encoded, which is indicated by the black border around the image file path/name.
  See section <span style="background: #c0c0c0"><a href="#OpeningPicCoderImage">Opening Encoded Image</a></span> for opening a previously picCoder encoded image,
  and section xxxx for options to encode this image.</p>
