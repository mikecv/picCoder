<h1>picCode User Guide</h1>

<a id="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><i><b>picCoder</b></i> enables data to be embedded inside
  particular image files using a technique called <i><span style="font-weight: normal">Steganography</span></i><span style="font-style: normal">,
  which comes from Greek steganographia, which combines the words stegan√≥s meaning &quot;covered or concealed&quot;, and -graphia
  meaning &quot;writing&quot;. In the case of </span><i><b>picCoder</b></i><span style="font-style: normal">, data is concealed in variations of the colour of image pixels.</span></p>
 
<a id="Features"></a>
<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Using </span><i><b>picCoder</b></i> you can embed data inside an image, share the image with someone else, and they can extract the embedded data.
  Embedded data can be any file with the size of the file only limited by the size of the image in which it is embedded.
  The application also supports a conversation function, where users can share the image containing the embedded conversation and pass messages to each other.
</p>

<a id="ImageTypes"></a>
<h2>Image Types Supported</h2>
  
<p>The nature of the data embedding employed means that if images are graphically manipulated after they have been encoded picCoder encoding may be corrupted.
  For this reason presently only .png images are supported as they support lossless compression.</p>

<a id="OpeningImage"></a>
<h2>Opening an Image</h2>

<p>To open an image use the <font color="#2a6099"><i>Open Image</i></font> option from the <font color="#2a6099"><i>File</i></font> menu as
  illustrated below. Alternatively, drag and drop an accepted image file (.png) onto the application window.</p>
  <br>
  <br>  
  <img src="openFileMenu.png" alt="Open file menu">
  <br>  

<p>If an accepted image file type was selected the image will be displayed in the application window as illustrated below.</p>
  <br>
  <br>  
  <img src="openedImage.png" alt="Opened image">
  <br>

<p>In the previous illustration the image file opened has not been <i><b>picCoder</b></i>
  encoded, which is indicated by the black border around the image file path/name.
  See section <span style="background: #c0c0c0"><a href="#OpeningPicCoderImage">Opening Encoded Image</a></span> for opening a previously picCoder encoded image,
  and section xxxx for options to encode this image.</p>

<a id="OpeningPicCoderImage"></a>
<h2>Opening a picCoder Encoded Image</h2>

<p>When an image is opened, the application checks the image to see if it is </span><i><b>picCoder</b></i><span style="font-style: normal"> encoded.
  This is done be scanning the image data for preamble data that all </span><i><b>picCoder</span></b></i><span style="font-style: normal"> encoded images have.
  If the image contains </span><i><b>picCoder</span></b></i><span style="font-style: normal"> embedded data this will be indicated in the detail below the image as illustrated below.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>  
  <img src="embeddedFile.png" alt="Opened image with embedded file">
  <br>  

<p>In the example above the image contains an embedded file, called <font color="#2a6099"><i>kylie2.png</i></font>.
  Below the details of the embedded file is a button marked <font color="#2a6099"><i>Extract Embedded File</i></font> used to extract and save the embedded file.</p>

<p>In a similar way, if the image contained an image included an embedded conversation there would be a button marked <font color="#2a6099"><i>Extract Embedded Conversation</i></font>
  used to extract and display the conversation as illustrated below.</p>
  <br>
  <br>  
  <img src="embeddedConversation.png" alt="Opened image with embedded conversation">
  <br>  

<p>Note that there are different coloured borders around the image file details for images with embedded files and embedded conversations.</p>
 
<a id="StartingConversation"></a>
<h2>Starting a New Conversation</h2>

<p>To start a new conversation open a supported image that you'll embed the conversation into,
  and then select <font color="#2a6099"><i>Start Conversation</i></font> from the <font color="#2a6099"><i>Edit</i></font> menu
  as illustrated below. Note that the menu item will not be available until an image file is opened.</p>
  <br>
  <br>  
  <img src="startConversation.png" alt="Start new conversation">
  <br>  

<p>This will display a empty <b>Conversation Editor</b> dialog as illustration below.</p>
  <br>
  <br>  
  <img src="newConversationDlg.png" alt="New conversation dialog">
  <br>  

<a id="AddingNewMessages"></a>
<h2>Adding Messages to a New Conversation</h2>

<p>The <b>Conversation Editor</b> dialog has an edit window at the bottom where a message can be edited,
  and a window above where committed messages are displayed.</p>

<p>The messaging editing window accepts rich text, so html tags can be used,
  although at this release this type of formatting must be done manually as illustration below.</p>
  <br>
  <br>  
  <img src="messageEntry.png" alt="Message entry">
  <br>  

<p>To commit a message select the <font color="#2a6099"><i>Tick</i></font> icon, as illustration below.
  To clear the edit window select the If the time between messages is less than a configured period the messages are grouped icon.</p>
  <br>
  <br>  
  <img src="populatedMessage.png" alt="First populated message">
  <br>  

<p>As illustrated above the message is displayed in a bubble, and show the author's name (or handle),
  the date and time of the message, and the message text it self.
  notice the rendering of the <b>bold</b> rich text that was entered in the edit window.</p>

<p>Additional messages can be added in the same way.
  As each message is entered and committed they are rendered in the upper window as illustrated below.</p>
  <br>
  <br>  
  <img src="populatedMessage-2.png" alt="Additional populated message">
  <br>  

<p>As illustrated above if the time between messages is less than a configured period the messages are grouped.
  and in this case only the first message in the group shows the author's handle and message timestamp.
  The time between messages for message grouping is specified in the configuration parameter <font color="#2a6099"><i>SameMsgTime</i></font>.</p>

<a id="EmbeddingConversation"></a>
<h2>Embedding the Conversation</h2>

<p>An option exists to add a password to the data embedded into the image.
  By default the configuration parameter <font color="#2a6099"><i>IncludePasswd</i></font> is used to specify this.
  This can be overriden from the <font color="#2a6099"><i>Edit</i></font> checkbox in the <font color="#2a6099"><i>Edit / Embed...</i></font> menu as illustrated below.</p>
  <br>
  <br>  
  <img src="embedWithPasswordMenu.png" alt="Embed with password checkbox">
  <br>  

<p>To embed the conversation into the image select <font color="#2a6099"><i>Embed Conversation</i></font> from the <font color="#2a6099"><i>Edit / Embed...</i></font> menu
  as illustrated below.</p>
